//! Hashing configuration to be used when building a circuit.
//!
//! This module defines a [`Hasher`] trait as well as its recursive
//! counterpart [`AlgebraicHasher`] for in-circuit hashing. It also
//! provides concrete configurations, one fully recursive leveraging
//! the Poseidon hash function both internally and natively, and one
//! mixing Poseidon internally and truncated Keccak externally.
